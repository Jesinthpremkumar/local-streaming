to stream movies and videos from laptop to mobile

you must have installed any webserver with directory to videos folder and set that port as ":8081" and assign static ip to you server as "192.168.1.110" then final link will be "192.168.1.110:8081"
it needs php to be installed 

p.s make sure you put php file in video folder

source code available in my another repo named Movies
